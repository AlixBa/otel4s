# otel4s

otel4s is an experimental [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
client for Scala built on [Cats
Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/).  It is a thin
abstraction, with an implementation backed by
[opentelemetry-java](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/api/all).

If successful, this will be offered to Typelevel.  If not, it will rot
here.

As of May 10, 2022, only the Metrics API is covered, and only
partially.  No artifacts are published yet.
